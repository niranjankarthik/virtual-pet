## What is Virtual Pet?

Virtual Pet is a tamagachi analog on steroids!

## How do I use Virtual Pet?

2 - You will be welcomed to the Virtual Pet Shelter and prompted to enter a pet name. Pick whatever name you want, but be advised that our display only shows names up to 14 characters, so choose wisely.

3 - You will be prompted to choose one of four possible species of Virtual Pet:

    1 - Organic Dog, 2 - Organic Cat
    3 - Robotic Dog, 4 - Robotic Cat

    Organic pets need food, water, and walking/cage cleaning, and robotic pets need oil and maintenance.
